          I graduated from Portland State University with my Bachelor's in
          computer science in june of 2023. I am working in my free time to
          learn about computer graphic design and application development.
          I enjoy legacy boardgames and am currently playing through Aeon
          Tresspass Odyssey. I also have 2 rescue cats, Mononoke and Orthos.

        <p class="output">
          Since 2019 I have been working for Vanguard EMS Inc. During My time
          at this company I have always worked closely with Test Automation 
          Engineers. After I graduated in June 2023 I took on that role and 
          have since created several programs for Vanguard. Unfortunately it
          is an ITAR facility and I cannot share any of the programs code.
          I have worked on a very large project to automate a manual test 
          reducing the time of the test from 45 minutes to 8 minutes. I 
          created a project that reads measurements from a multimeter and writes
          them to a file in CSV format. I have also created a program that executes
          command line arguements on multiple applications and returns the responses
          to the user in a readable format.

          The previous projects I have completed are compiled in the git
          repository below. While all the programs compiled show my progress
          throughout my education, CS163 program 2 and CS202 program 3 are the
          best showcases of my education. Since both of these programs were
          homework assignments they don't have names.
        </p>
        <p class="output">
          CS163 Program 2 was built to be the card game War. However it was also
          meant to train my ability to use the stack, data structures, and
          queues. It was written in C++ during my first year at Portland State
          University.
        </p>
        <p class="output">
          CS202 Program 3 was built to be a notebook application that can store,
          modify, remove, or display any website, news station, or zoom meetings
          the user wanted to. This application was meant to teach me about using
          more complex data structures and object oriented programming. It was
          written in C++ during my second year at Portland State University.
