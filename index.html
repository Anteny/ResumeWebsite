          I graduated from Portland State University with my Bachelor's in
          computer science in june of 2023. I am working in my free time to
          learn about computer graphic design and application development.
          I enjoy legacy boardgames and am currently playing through Aeon
          Tresspass Odyssey. I also have 2 rescue cats, Mononoke and Orthos.

        <p class="output">
          Since 2019 I have been working for Vanguard EMS Inc. During My time
          at this company I have always worked closely with Test Automation 
          Engineers. After I graduated in June 2023 I took on that role and 
          have since created several programs for Vanguard. Unfortunately it
          is an ITAR facility and I cannot share any of the programs code.
          <br />I have worked on a very large project to automate a manual test 
          reducing the time of the test from 45 minutes to 8 minutes. <br />I 
          created a project that reads measurements from a multimeter and writes
          them to a file in CSV format for import into excel. <br />I have also created 
          a program that executes command line arguements on multiple applications and 
          returns the responses to the user in a readable format.

        <p class="output">
          This was my senior project. During this project I worked with a group of
          six other students. We were tasked with the company Pacstar to make a 
          program that they would incorporate into their company process. What Pacstar
          needed was a program that extraced their test data, cleaned it up, then uploaded
          it to a database they created. One unique part of this project is that the team
          emulated a Pacstar software engineering team. This included weekly check-ins, 
          using Jira and Confluence, and implementing code reviews. As an ETL program this 
          project had three major parts. <br />The first part of the project was the extraction.
          The tests that Pacstar ran resulted in hundreds of thousands of lines per test. Our
          program extracted only relevent information which was determined by Pacstar. <br />
          The second part of the program is tranformation. While we got the relevent data locations
          not all of the data was correct. We sanatized the data removing any unwanted characters 
          that could cause security risks, and making sure the data was in the correct format.
          <br />The last part of the program was loading the extracted and transformed data into
          Pacstars database. Knowing the structure of the data and database made creating the SQL 
          commands easy.

          CS163 Program 2 was built to be the card game War. However it was also
          meant to train my ability to use the stack, data structures, and
          queues. It was written in C++ during my first year at Portland State
          University.

          CS202 Program 3 was built to be a notebook application that can store,
          modify, remove, or display any website, news station, or zoom meetings
          the user wanted to. This application was meant to teach me about using
          more complex data structures and object oriented programming. It was
          written in C++ during my second year at Portland State University.
